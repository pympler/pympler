Release 0.2
===========

The second release is one of several steps to better integrate the different
sub-systems of Pympler. All modules now directly reside in the pympler namespace
which simplifies the import of Pympler modules.  Pympler 0.2 introduces a web
interface to facilitate memory profiling.  Pympler now fully supports Python
3.x. This release also adds several modules replacing the *Heapmonitor* module
with the new *class tracker* facility.

  * Introduce web frontend

  * Split Heapmonitor into several new modules

  * New `process` module to obtain memory statistics of the Python process

  * Improved garbage illustration which can directly render directed graphs
    using graphviz


Release 0.1
===========

This initial release is the first step to unify three separate Python memory
profiling tools. We aim to create a place-to-go for Python developers who want
to monitor and analyze the memory usage of their applications. It is just the
first step towards a further integration. There is still lots of work that
needs to be done and we stress that the API is subject to change. Any feedback
you want to give us, wishes, bug reports, or feature requests please send them
to **pympler-dev@googlegroups.com**.


  * First Public Release.
